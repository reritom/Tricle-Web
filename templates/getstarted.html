    <li>Once you have logged in, on the Start page you'll be shown a form asking for three keys, the images you want to scramble, and whether you want to scramble or unscramble</li>
<br>
    <li>The order of your keys is important and must be remembered. The keys can be whatever you want, but try not to make them too obvious</li>
<br>
    <li>The keys are case-sensitive, should be at least three characters long, and shouldn't contain whitespace</li>
<br>
    <li>Select the bmp/jpeg images that you want to hide, select scramble, and click start</li>
<br>
    <li>Or if you want to unhide some images, select unscramble</li>
<br>
    <li>You'll be redirected to a download page. The download should start automatically, but if it doesn't, click the download button</li>
<br>
    <li>Once you have downloaded your processed files, click the blue button, which will remove any temporary files left on our servers</li>
