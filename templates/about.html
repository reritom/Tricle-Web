  <h2><span style="font-weight:lighter;">What is </span><strong>Tricl√©</strong></h2>

  <p style="font-size:1.25em;">Tricle uses an algorithm and three user given keys to scramble the pixels of an image.
     This acts as a form of soft encryption, meaning you can keep you images close and accessible while
     also keeping them safe from wandering eyes.</p>

  <p style="font-size:1.25em;">Most methods for image privacy rely on either using hard encryption or putting images into
     password protected galleries. While both of these methods have their benefits, hard encryption
     requires complex software which usually costs money, and secure galleries aren't much use
      if you wish to privately send your images around.</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.25em;">Tricle will hide your image within itself. This means its as easy to deal with as any other image,
       yet keeps its contents secure and can only be unscrambled using the three keys.
       This process also allows for you to use additional privacy protection methods
       such as typical encryption if you so desire.</p>

  <h2>Why the three keys?</h2>

  <p style="font-size:1.25em;">Instead of using a single password or key to scramble the image, our algorithm uses three keys.
    There are a handful of reasons why our algorithm uses three keys as opposed to a password, so we'll list the important ones below:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:1.25em;">
      <li>These days everything uses passwords and keys, and unfortunately a lot of people use the same password for multiple things.
        If someone finds the password to your laptop and it happens to be the same as the key for your encryption,
         then there is no point in the encryption. </li>

      <li>By using three keys, the user is being forced to come up with something more unique, thus improving the security of the process.</li>

      <li>By using three keys, the user can come up with a memorable phrase to scramble their image with.</li>
      <br>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em;">Each key can consist of <strong>any characters</strong> and must be a <strong>minimum of three characters</strong> and a <strong>maximum of twenty</strong>
       characters. The keys are also <strong>case sensitive</strong>. This is primarily for simplicity, but in later versions of the algorithm
      these constraints are likely to change.

  <h2>What information do you collect?</h2>
  <p style="font-size:1.25em;">What information do you collect?
As of release, no information is collected on our users. This means that none of your images are stored by us or even
 visible to us and we don't collect anything that can identify the user.
This is by design as we value the privacy of our users and because nothing is collected server-side.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.25em;">However, there are plans to collect minimal information in the future, such as a vague location
   at either county or state level (meaning if for example, you live in London, all we know is that
    we have a user in London). Why? It would be interesting for us to know whether the site has gathered
     momentum in an specific areas, and would allow us to see whether any future marketing techniques are having an impact.
  But if this plan proceeds, all existing users will be notified beforehand.</p>
